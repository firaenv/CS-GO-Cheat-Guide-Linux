- Launch CS:GO

- Press `Insert` and there you go!

## What's included

I included a pre compiled version of [Osiris](https://github.com/danielkrupinski/Osiris).

## Cheats

The Cheat used is listed above, but there are many other great ones.

## Compilation

- Install Deps:
```console
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libsdl2-dev gcc-10 g++-10
```
- Compile it:
```console
$ mkdir Release && cd Release && cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-10 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-10 ..
```
- Make it:
```console
$ make -j $(nproc --all)
```


## How To

Simpily Run the ./load script when CS:GO is loaded.

If you get errors, make sure you ran:
```console
$ chmod +x ./load.sh
```
